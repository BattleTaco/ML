# ML

Repository that contains my journey with learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Most of the exercises I've learned were done on either Jupyter Notebook or in a Python IDE like Spyder. Feel free to look over and check out the datasets and code I used. Some files are also answer sheets but are clearly stated as so.
